# MachineLearning-Coursera-AssignmentSolutions

My solution to the assignments on Intro to Machine Learning from Stanford University as available in the MOOC platform Coursera. (Course by Andrew Ng)

I have tried to keep only the information that is relevant for those who are currently taking the course and need to check other solutions or just need to review the practical content of the course. Please note my solutions date back to 2015 and might bot be accurate or valid in future course editions. 

All the solutions where implemented in Matlab and the description for each assignment is included. I strongly recommend this course as an intro to Machine Learning even though Matlab / Octave might not be the most suitable language to deepen into this field. Again that is only my personal view.
